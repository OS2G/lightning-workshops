Learn a new trick in 10 minutes or less!
### Goal
Each guide in this repository is meant to teach you how to do something new/useful at an entry level, like a collection of Hello Worlds.

Lots of tools are complex and versatile. While it is conceptually interesting to talk about the materials used to make a screwdriver or how various heads distribute force differently, all you really need to know is lefty-loosy, rightie-tighty, and *don't* strip the screw.

### Contents
This repo contains guides for:
- Using [Wireshark to run a speedtest](https://github.com/OS2G/lightning-workshops/blob/main/wireshark-speedtest.md) of your internet
- Doing a basic [network scan using nmap](https://github.com/OS2G/lightning-workshops/blob/main/nmap-basic-scan.md)

#### New Guides are welcome via Pull Request, as are issues to suggest things of interest!

### Guidelines for writing a guide
Things that take 2 minutes or less when you know exactly what to do are generally exactly the kind of thing that fits in this repo. The main thing the guide provides is knowing exactly what to do when there are a lot of options that are potentially confusing, or little specific ways to do particular things that are difficult to figure out on one's own. In short, knowing the sequence of operations necessary to do something is the tricky part.

Second, keep explanations separate from the actual steps, or at least make the step itself clear first so the student knows what they're trying to make happen. They're mainly necessary when debugging something that didn't work right; if someone wants the details before they start pushing buttons, they'll read further along before clicking buttons.

### Some ideas
- Arduino Blinky tutorial
- Put an OS on a raspberry pi
- Using yt-dlp
- Hello World for ML
